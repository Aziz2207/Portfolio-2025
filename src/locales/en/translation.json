    "description": "I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student at Polytechnique Montréal with a strong interest in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and applied mathematics. I previously worked as a web developer at PolyOrbite, a technical society, where I contributed to the development and maintenance of the organization’s website. More recently, I completed a software engineering internship at Poslik, a company providing point-of-sale (POS) solutions for restaurants. During this internship, I contributed to the development of an inventory management module by analyzing functional requirements, designing the technical architecture, and implementing core features such as quantity tracking, stock comparison, and automated adjustments. Working with PHP, Symfony, and PostgreSQL, I helped improve consistency between physical and digital inventories and streamline operational workflows. I am particularly motivated by projects that combine system design, cloud infrastructure, and data-driven solutions, and I enjoy building scalable, well-structured software systems.",
