    "title": "Hi! I'm Aziz",
    "description": "I am a third-year Software Engineering student at Polytechnique Montréal with a strong passion for system design, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. Previously, I was a web developer at PolyOrbite, a technical society where I contributed to the organization’s website. More recently, I completed a software engineering internship at Poslik, a company offering innovative point-of-sale (POS) solutions tailored for restaurants. During this internship, I developed an inventory management module by analyzing functional requirements, designing the technical architecture, and implementing core features such as quantity input, stock comparison, and automatic adjustments. Working with PHP, Symfony, and PostgreSQL, I contributed to improving the consistency between physical and digital inventories and streamlining restaurant operations. My experience reflects my enthusiasm for building innovative and impactful solutions.",
